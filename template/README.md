# Getting Started with Awesome React Template

This is the base template created by Rajan Gautam for [Create React App](https://github.com/rgautam320/Awesome-React).

## Start App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Thank you for using this Template
